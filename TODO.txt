Fix memory leak in 'SerialWidget::initOptionsWidget()' in file: 'serial_widget.cpp'

Add configurable limits for ServoBoard Max and Min values (ie. adjustable range) ex: 0-97
	-Factor out constants to a single file

Respond to global values seqReplay, PWMSweep, PWM replay

Factor out maps for PWMRepeat and SequenceRepeat to have one map for all classes.

Highlighting as the play functions runs
	-stop and pause for playing sequences.

Get the save function working correctly. 
	-check if there are unsaved changes on close/load and prompt to save.

The keep changes without prompt is unchecked at the start, but acts as though it has been checked.

Make the interactions for playing and pausing cleaner, maybe have buttons showing and hiding when they are (not) needed.

Check to see if freeze really works at all. 

Get the save function working correctly. 
	-check for save or save as on exit.

Find out if the timer in ServoBoardController is leaking memory.

A way to set the global sequence delay and repeat.

Make advanced options popup cleaner.

Add a way to drag and drop in SER and SERVO files to have them open over what is there.

Make a "live mode" where dragging the sliders/spin boxes makes an instant change on the board
	-can take 'snapshots' of a position and save it.
	-used to quickly build up a sequence.

Add an automatic updater to grab updates from a server.

Make a real style sheet for all the pages, add images to the play button ect. 
	-Make the background colors constant.

ADAM QUESTIONABLE DESIGN CHOICES

Got rid of position inheriting QObject, it didn't need any of the function, and a copy constructor is great for such a small class.
